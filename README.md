# Hardening as Code (HaC) Project

This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts to automate security configurations and best practices for Linux systems, implementing Hardening as Code (HaC) from the hardware level to the application level.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a set of scripts that can be used to harden Linux systems, making them more secure by automating various security measures. The scripts cover configurations related to the operating system, network security, user accounts, kernel hardening, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Linux system (compatible with Debian-based distributions only).
- `sudo` privileges for executing system-level commands.
- Basic knowledge of Bash scripting.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eljakani/HaC.git
    cd HaC
    ```

2. Run the scripts:

    ```bash
    chmod +x run.sh
    ./run.sh
    ```

3. Follow any prompts and instructions provided by the scripts.
